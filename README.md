Introduction to Windows Development with C#
=============

This repository has been created for the Introduction to Windows Development with C# course taught by Jeff Gonzalez.

It contains practice exercises and some guidance for students learning C#.

The practices are listed in the **practices** folder. One week before the second half of the class, I will add a "solutions" folder with examples of how these practices might be accomplished.
