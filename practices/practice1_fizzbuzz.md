Fizz Buzz
=========

FizzBuzz is a common programming challenge. Here's the gist:

Create a windows console application that prints out the numbers 1-100.

If the number you are printing is divisible by 3, print out the word "Fizz" instead of the number.

If the number you are printing is divisible by 5, print out the word "Buzz" instead of the number.

If the number is divisible by both 3 and by 5, print out FizzBuzz instead of the number.

If it doesn't meet these criteria, simply print the number.

Your output should look similar to the following:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
